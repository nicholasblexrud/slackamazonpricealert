# slack-amazonpricebot

Slack Amazon Price Bot is a slack bot built using nightmare.js to scrape an amazon url and return a price that then gets to a slack channel. 

I have this setup as a cron job that runs every hour.

TODO:
  1) Turn into a node module.
  2) Get setup running on Azure.
  3) Create an API that is easier to add configs too.
  4) Write unit tests.
